# Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Advisor

This Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with our Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Recommender API. Users can input their cloud infrastructure decisions and receive recommendations about potential vulnerabilities.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface built with Streamlit
- Real-time recommendations based on user input
- Seamless integration with the Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Recommender API
- Environment-based configuration for easy deployment

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- Requests library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csye7125-su24-team08/cve-rag-ui.git
cd cve-rag-ui
```
2. Activate virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following variable:

```
API_URL=http://your-api-server-url/recommend
```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3. In the text area, enter your cloud infrastructure decision or question.

4. Click the "Get Recommendations" button to receive vulnerability recommendations.

5. The recommendations will be displayed below the input area.

## Application Structure

```
Chatbot.py          # Main Streamlit application file
requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
.env                # Environment variables (not tracked in git)
README.md           # This file
```

## Environment Variables

- `API_URL`: The URL of your Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Recommender API endpoint

## How It Works

1. The user enters their cloud infrastructure decision into the text area.
2. When the "Get Recommendations" button is clicked, the application sends a POST request to the API_URL.
3. The API processes the request and returns recommendations.
4. The Streamlit app displays the recommendations to the user.

## Customization

You can easily customize the appearance and behavior of the Streamlit app by modifying the `Chatbot.py` file. Refer to the [Streamlit documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/) for more information on available components and styling options.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter connection errors, ensure that the `API_URL` in your `.env` file is correct and that the API server is running.
- For any other issues, check the Streamlit output in your terminal for error messages.
